// it came. A late item raises the lead in steps, up to MAX_LEAD, and plays at

// a calm minute the lead goes down slowly again (sound plays 0.5 % faster
// meanwhile, see rate; nobody hears that), while the slowest item since
// then still had more than MIN_LEAD to spare. Only items move it: at most
// IDLE seconds of drift per item, so a still screen share that sends one
// picture a minute still shows it.
