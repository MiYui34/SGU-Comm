## 2026-10-14: Project start

Goal: a Mumble client with a Discord-like UI. Web first, desktop (Tauri) later.

Architecture for the web version:

- Browsers cannot open raw TCP/TLS or UDP sockets. A small proxy
  (`packages/proxy`) bridges a WebSocket to the TLS control channel of one
  fixed Mumble server. It is not an open proxy.
- The browser speaks the Mumble protocol itself (`packages/protocol`). The
  proxy only moves bytes. Because of this, the same protocol code can later
  run in a Tauri shell with a native TCP socket.
- Voice will go through UDPTunnel messages on the TCP channel, with Opus
  encode/decode by WebCodecs. This costs some latency against real UDP, but
  keeps the proxy simple. A WebRTC bridge is an option for later.
- `Mumble.proto` comes from mumble-voip/mumble `master`. The message order in
  the file is the same as the TCP message type IDs (0..26).
